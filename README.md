# The recipe and frugal guides
_"Genius appreciates simplicity, Idiot appreciates complexity."_ - Terry A. Davis


### General Guidelines:
- Bread recipes should be in bakers ratios or percentages
- Keep things in metric when possible. Use metric.
- Use markdown standardized format (look [example](example.md))
- No links to specific products.
- No trash recipes.

### TODO
- Reformat all that stuff
