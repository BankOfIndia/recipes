# DIY recipes

this is a collaboration of recipes from Lainchan.org /DIY.  contributions should be in plaintext format.
PDF accepted when necessary.

### General Guidelines:
- Bread recipes should be in bakers ratios or percentages
- Keep things in metric when possible.
- If it feels like something you'd find Guy Fieri or Paula Deen trying to cook or eat, try to avoid it.  
- Avoid recipes that are over-reliant on prepared items.  this is DIY, not Sandra Lee's Kwanzaa Cake...


### TO DO:
explain how to cook the 32 recipes ive added :P
