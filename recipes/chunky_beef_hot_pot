Chunky beef hot pot

Ingredients (serves 4):
2 tbsp olive oil
680g (1lb 9oz) braised beef steak
1 onion, chopped
2 large carrots, peeled and cut into thick batons
150g (5Â½oz) swede, peeled and cut into thick batons
175g (6oz) parsnips, peeled and cut into thick batons

Ingredients cont:
2 garlic cloves, crushed
1 tbsp plain flour
300ml (Â½ pint) ginger beer
300ml (Â½ pint) beef stock
2 tbsp tomato purÃ©e
2 bay leaves

Recipe method:
Preheat the oven to gas mark 4/180ÂºC/160ÂºC fan oven. Heat the oil in a lidded flame- or oven-proof casserole pan and cook the beef in batches for 5 minutes, until brown. Remove and set aside.
Heat the pan again and add the onion, carrots, swede, parsnips and garlic. Cook gently for 5â€“8 minutes until starting to soften.
Return the beef and sprinkle over the flour. Cook for 1 minute then pour in the ginger beer, stock, tomato purÃ©e and bay leaves. Bring to the boil, cover and cook for 2 hours until tender and juices have reduced and thickened.
Remove bay leaves, season and serve.

Top tip:
This tastes even better if made the day before, as it lets the flavours infuse and the meat tenderise.
