Vegan Meatloaf
==============

### Ingredients
- 1/2 cup onion, diced small or pulse in the food processor a few times. 
- 14 ounces chickpeas, canned, drained - save the aquafaba and freeze it for future recipes 
- 2 cups portobello mushrooms 
- 1 1/2 cups rolled oats, ground 
- 1 cup cooked green split peas 
- 2 tablespoons flaxseed meal 
- 1 teaspoon ground sage 
- 1 teaspoon salt 
- 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper 
- 1/2 cup vital wheat gluten

### The wet Ingredients to Mix:
- 6 tablespoons tomato paste 
- 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 
- 2 tablespoons tamari 
- 1/2 teaspoon liquid smoke

#### Instructions:

- Cut parchment paper to fit inside the bottom of the loaf pan.  I like to do it in both directions.  See the photo below.  You really don't have to do it both ways but I would lay it to fit the width instead of length. 
- Set out your largest mixing bowl and a food processor. 
- Add the chickpeas to the food processor and pulse a few times to chop up so that none of the chickpeas are whole. Place in the mixing bowl. 
- Add 1/3rd the mushrooms to the food processor.  Pulse a few times until the mushrooms are pretty small pieces.  Place in the large mixing bowl and continue with the rest of the mushrooms, 1/3rd at a time. 
- Place the rolled oats into the food processor and grind small to measure 1 cup.  Add to the large mixing bowl. 
- Cook the green split peas to measure 1 cup after it is cooked. Add to the mixing bowl. 
- To the mixing bowl add onion, flaxseed meal, sage, salt, and pepper.  NOT the vital wheat gluten. 
- Preheat the oven to 400°. 
- In a small bowl mix all of the wet ingredients. 
- Mix all of the ingredients in the large mixing bowl.  Now add the vital wheat gluten and mix. 
- Right away, after adding the vital wheat gluten mix in the wet ingredient mix. 
- Pack into the prepared loaf pan and lightly press the mixture down.  Firmly to make contact but not packed down hard. 
- Bake at 400 degrees for 40 minutes. 
- Remove from the oven and let the pan cool on a wire rack for about 10 minutes.  Now get ahold of the parchment paper and lift the 'meatloaf' out and serve.
