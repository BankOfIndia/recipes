A blondie is the opposite of a brownie, and generally more 
frugal to prepare as it does not rely on chocolate

1/2 cup (1 stick, 112 g) of butter, melted
1 cup (220 g) of tightly packed dark brown sugar
1 egg, lightly beaten
1 teaspoon of vanilla
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon of baking soda
Pinch of salt
1 cup (128 g)  of all-purpose flour
1/3 cup (60 g) of butterscotch chips (chopped walnuts and chocolate chips are equally tasty)

bake 350 for 20-25 min.
